            Musical instruments are the heartbeat of music. They are the tools through which sound is shaped into melody, rhythm, and harmony. From the ancient drums carved out of hollowed logs to the high-tech synthesizers of modern studios, instruments have evolved alongside human culture. Each instrument carries its own voice, character, and cultural significance‚Äîwhether it's the soulful cry of a violin, the steady pulse of a djembe, or the bright chime of a piano. Together, they form the foundation upon which musical expression is built.
          </p>

          <p>
            The beauty of instruments lies not just in how they sound, but in how they connect people across time and place. They tell stories of invention, tradition, and passion. Here are two stories that highlight the deep relationship between people and their instruments:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Ray Charles</strong>, blind from a young age, found freedom and identity through the piano. It became his voice, leading him to blend gospel, blues, and jazz into a unique sound that broke barriers in American music.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Paul McCartney</strong>, inspired by an old acoustic guitar his father gave him, went on to write some of the most iconic songs of the 20th century‚Äîproving how a single instrument can shape the soundtrack of an era.

          <p>Notes are the basic elements of music, each representing a specific pitch and duration. They are named using the letters A to G and are placed on the staff to show what and how to play.</p>
           <p>Learning notes helps musicians read, write, and play music accurately. It is the first step in understanding how melodies and harmonies are created.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Notes have pitch (e.g., C, D, E) and length (e.g., whole, half, quarter).
            </li>
            <li>The placement on the staff shows how high or low the sound is.</li>
          </ul>
          <code>  
              üéµ Example: The note C is located on the first ledger line below the treble clef.

        <article>
          <p>
            Rhythm is the timing of music‚Äîit organizes sounds and silences into patterns. It tells us how long to hold a note and when to play it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Strong rhythm helps keep music steady and gives it movement, making it essential for solo and group performances.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Beats form the pulse of the music; notes divide the beat.</li>
            <li>Note values (e.g., quarter note = 1 beat) show duration.</li>
          </ul>
          <code>üéµ Example: Four quarter notes = 1, 2, 3, 4 in a 4/4 time signature.</code>

          An interval is the distance between two musical notes. It tells us how far apart the notes are in pitch, which affects how they sound together.
          </p>
          <p>
          Understanding intervals helps musicians create harmony and recognize melodies by ear.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
         Named by number (e.g., 2nd, 3rd, 5th).
         </li>
         <li>
Intervals are the building blocks of chords and scales.
</li>
</ul>
 <code>
üéµ Example: From C to E is a major 3rd (C-D-E).

      <section class="main-section" id="Chords">
        <header>Chords</header>
        <p>
          Chords are groups of notes played together to form harmony. They are built by stacking intervals (often in thirds) above a root note.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chords give music its mood‚Äîmajor sounds happy, minor sounds sad or serious.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
         A basic chord (triad) uses 3 notes: root, third, and fifth.
</li>
<li>
Chords support melodies and help shape the structure of songs.
         </li>
         <code>
üéµ Example: C major chord = C ‚Äì E ‚Äì G

          <p>
           Scales are ordered sets of notes that follow a specific pattern. They provide the notes used in a song and help define its sound or ‚Äúkey.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p>
            Practicing scales builds technique and helps with improvisation and composing.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Major scale = pattern of whole and half steps (W-W-H-W-W-W-H).</li>
            <li>Every key has its own scale (e.g., G major, D minor).</li>
          </ul>
          <code>
            üéµ Example: C Major scale = C ‚Äì D ‚Äì E ‚Äì F ‚Äì G ‚Äì A ‚Äì B ‚Äì C

          <p>
            A key signature tells which notes are sharp or flat in a piece of music. It appears at the beginning of each line and defines the song's tonal center.
          </p>

          <p>
            Knowing key signatures helps with playing in tune and reading music more fluently.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>C major has no sharps or flats; G major has F#.</li>
            <li>Each key has a matching scale and chord structure.</li>
          </ul>
          <code>üéµ Example: Key of G major = F# in the key signature.</code>

            Instruments are tools that produce musical sound. They are grouped by how they make sound: strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and keyboards.
          </p>

          <p>
            Understanding different instruments helps with arranging, performing, and listening to music more deeply.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each instrument has a unique sound and technique.</li>
            <li>Some play melody (e.g., flute), others rhythm or harmony (e.g., drums, piano).</li>
          </ul>
          <code>
            üéµ Example: The piano can play both melody and chords at once.

            A genre is a category of music defined by its style, form, and cultural background. Examples include classical, jazz, rock, pop, hip-hop, and folk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exploring genres helps students understand music's diversity and how different styles use instruments, rhythm, and harmony.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each genre has its own instruments, rhythm, and structure.</li>
            <li>Studying multiple genres improves creativity and listening skills.</li>
          </ul>
          <code>
            üéµ Example: Jazz often uses swing rhythm and 7th chords.
